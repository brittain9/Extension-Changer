# Extension-Changer
Easily change file extensions from the command line

# Usage: 
### python3 \<filename\>.py \<Directory of Files\> \<current_extension\> \<new_extension\> [\<copy\> default = False]

If copy is set to true, the new files will be copied to new folder with the corresponding extension name.

Note: This replicates what it would be like if you renamed the file extension from the file explorer. Files may not work correctly.
